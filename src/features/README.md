# FEATURES

## What is this? ❓

This folder is the project's FEATURES/BUSINESS LOGICS. This is where the cool things happen 😎.

It could be separate pages, user flows, 3rd party integrations, complex forms, ...

## Principles 📚

We try to utilize industry best-practices at the best of our capabilities. This evolves everyday but the core revolves around:

- DRY
- Composition
- Consistency
- Reusability
- Testability

## Requirements 📦

A couple of simple requirements for features-level implementations:

- Each feature should be as self-sufficient as possible
- It should depend on other features in the form of composition/injection.
- Each feature should provide an `index.ts` as a gateway to use it.

## Bonuses 🍒

These are entire ***OPTIONAL***, if you can explain your thought process
on how to gradually tackle them, it's already a big plus ✅
