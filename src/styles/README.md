# STYLES

## What is this? 🖼

This folder is the project's STYLES. This is where tailwind lives.

Generally, you wouldn't need more than this `globals.css` file, but who knows 👻?

## Principles 👩‍🎨

- Try to accomplish most things in tailwind's tokenized system.
- One-off styles should be in JIT arbitrary values.

- Consider what should/should not be in this `globals.css` file

## Bonuses 🏖
