# TYPES

## What is this? 😳

This folder is the project's TYPESCRIPT folder. This is where we make TypeScript cool & reusable.

It could be 3rd party lib declarations, utility types, or common types shared across the application.

## Principles 🏛

Utility types are cool, use 'em.

## Requirements 🕶

Prop types, local interfaces, and types that are not reusable should be in their respective feature folders & not here.

## Bonuses 🍒

These are entire ***OPTIONAL***, if you can explain your thought process
on how to gradually tackle them, it's already a big plus ✅
